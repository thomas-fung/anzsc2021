  abstract = {A zero-inflated Poisson mixed autoregression model is presented for analyzing time series of count events with excess zeros. The model is motivated by the evaluation of a participatory ergonomics intervention intended to reduce manual handling workplace injuries over a specified time period. Random effects are introduced into the linear predictor of the model to account for serial correlation between successive observations. Parameter estimation is achieved by maximizing an appropriate log-likelihood function to obtain approximate residual maximum likelihood estimates. The method enables the evaluation of occupational intervention using population level aggregated count data series containing extra zeros.},

  abstract = {Zero inflation means that the proportion of 0’s of a model is greater than the proportion of 0’s of the corresponding Poisson model, which is a common phenomenon in count data. To model the zero-inflated characteristic of time series of counts, we propose zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial INGARCH models, which are useful and flexible generalizations of the Poisson and negative binomial INGARCH models, respectively. The stationarity conditions and the autocorrelation function are given. Based on the EM algorithm, the estimating procedure is simple and easy to be implemented. A simulation study shows that the estimation method is accurate and reliable as long as the sample size is reasonably large. A real data example leads to superior performance of the proposed models compared with other competitive models in the literature.},

  abstract = {Count time series are frequently encountered in biomedical, epidemiological and public health applications. In principle, such series may exhibit three distinctive features: overdispersion, zero-inflation and temporal correlation. Developing a modelling framework that is sufficiently general to accommodate all three of these characteristics poses a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible class of dynamic models in the state-space framework. Certain models that have been previously introduced in the literature may be viewed as special cases of this model class. For parameter estimation, we devise a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, where particle filtering and particle smoothing methods are employed to approximate the high-dimensional integrals in the E-step of the algorithm. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we consider an application based on the evaluation of a participatory ergonomics intervention, which is designed to reduce the incidence of workplace injuries among a group of hospital cleaners. The data consists of aggregated monthly counts of work-related injuries that were reported before and after the intervention.},
